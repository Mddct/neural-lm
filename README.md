# TODO
- [ ] adaptive softmax for large voca (because pytorch offical implementation can't work with torchscript)
- [ ] gru (should support tie_embedding)
- [ ] gru fusion on wenet runtime ctc prefix beam search
- [ ] transformer-xl with cache
- [ ] transformer-xl with cache to fusion 
- [ ] mwer training when lm fusion
